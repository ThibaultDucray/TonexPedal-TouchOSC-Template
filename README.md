# What is TonexPedal-TouchOSC-Template?

Bothered by the impossibility of setting up the ToneX Pedal directly from ToneX software? Use this template with [TouchOSC](https://hexler.net/touchosc)!

Complete template to parameter the ToneX pedal from your computer using MIDI (standard MIDI or MIDI over USB). Switch presets, activate / deactivate effects (Reverb, Compressor, NoiseGate, Equalizer, Modulations, Delays), tune effects parameters, save the pedalboard (noise gate, compressos, modulations, delays, reverbs) in one of the 20 presets.

# Download

Download and install [TouchOSC from Hexler.net](https://hexler.net/touchosc).
Download the [ToneX-controler-3.tosc file](https://github.com/ThibaultDucray/TonexPedal-TouchOSC-Template/blob/main/ToneX-controler-3.tosc) in the files section of this GitHub project.

# Configuration

Set your ToneX Pedal to MIDI channel 2 (or change all messages inside message mapping view to the desired MIDI channel).

# Limitation

Cannot read the settings from the Tonex Pedal (limitation of the pedal itself).
SAVE the file after use to keep the 20 presets saved in TouchOSC.
